Documentation: 

This documentation is written to provide with an overview and context of the design and development of my Chinese-style parkour game, titled "A Thousand Volumes of Beauty" or "万卷芳华" in Chinese. This project aims to showcase the beautiful poems of ancient Chinese women poets, who have often been overlooked in comparison to their male counterparts. It is a tranquil, relaxed, and healing game, featuring captivating music and a visually appealing user interface.

Introduction:
The primary objective of "A Thousand Volumes of Beauty" is to pay homage to the poetic works of ancient Chinese women poets and shed light on their significant contributions to literature. By incorporating their poems into the gameplay, the game seeks to create an immersive experience that fosters appreciation and awareness of their artistic achievements.

Design Concept:
The game's design revolves around creating a serene and immersive environment that captures the essence of classical Chinese aesthetics. The visual elements, such as the scenery, plants, and properties, draw inspiration from traditional Chinese ink art forms.

Gameplay Mechanics:
Players navigate through various levels, each inspired by different ancient Chinese poems written by different female poets. The goal is to explore the intricately designed landscapes, overcome obstacles, and collect fragments of the poems scattered throughout the game world. As players progress, they unlock new levels and gain a deeper understanding of the poets' emotions and narratives.

Development Challenges:
During the development process, I encountered numerous challenges that demanded perseverance and creativity to surmount. These obstacles encompassed achieving a seamless integration of the poems into the gameplay, striking a delicate balance between challenge and maintaining a serene atmosphere, and seamlessly transitioning between diverse levels and scenes. Due to the contrasting contexts of Chinese and English, effectively conveying the original meaning and emotional resonance of the poems proved exceedingly challenging. To address this, I employed AI-generated images to vividly express the environments and emotions, enhancing the overall experience.

Future Improvements:
I am committed to continuously enhancing "A Thousand Volumes of Beauty" to provide players with an even more enjoyable and engaging experience. Some areas of improvement I plan to focus on include expanding the selection of poems and poets featured in the game, refining the gameplay mechanics based on player feedback, and optimizing the graphics and performance for a wider range of devices.

In conclusion, "A Thousand Volumes of Beauty" is an artistic and culturally significant game that seeks to bring attention to the often-neglected works of ancient Chinese women poets. By combining tranquil gameplay, beautiful music, and a visually pleasing user interface, the game aims to provide players with a relaxing and immersive experience while fostering appreciation for the rich literary heritage of China.
